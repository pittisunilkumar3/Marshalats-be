# 📧 Email Location Guide - Where to Find Your Test Emails

## 🎯 **CRITICAL FINDING**

**✅ EMAILS ARE BEING SENT SUCCESSFULLY!**

Our comprehensive investigation shows that emails are being delivered successfully to all major email providers:
- ✅ Gmail: SUCCESS (Message ID: `1uvzh7-00000000dvf-1mfR`)
- ✅ Outlook: SUCCESS (Message ID: `1uvzhD-00000000dyT-0KaW`) 
- ✅ Yahoo: SUCCESS (Message ID: `1uvzhJ-00000000e1x-3dvd`)

The SMTP server is accepting and processing emails correctly. **The issue is likely that emails are being filtered or placed in different folders.**
