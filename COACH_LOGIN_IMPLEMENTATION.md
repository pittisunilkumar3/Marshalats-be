- **Status**: ✅ Working

### 2. **Coach Profile Endpoint**
- **URL**: `GET /api/coaches/me`
- **Purpose**: Get current authenticated coach's profile
- **Status**: ✅ Working

### 3. **Authentication Integration**

- **Status**: ✅ Working

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created

1. **models/coach_models.py**
   - Added `CoachLogin` model for login requests
   - Added `CoachLoginResponse` model for login responses

2. **controllers/coach_controller.py**
   - Added `login_coach()` method
   - Fixed password field reference (`password_hash` vs `hashed_password`)
   - Added comprehensive error handling

3. **routes/coach_routes.py**
   - Added `POST /api/coaches/login` endpoint
   - Added `GET /api/coaches/me` endpoint

4. **utils/unified_auth.py**
   - Extended to handle coach tokens from coaches collection
   - Supports role checking for coaches

### Authentication Flow

```
1. Coach Login: POST /api/coaches/login
   Input: {"email": "coach@example.com", "password": "password"}
   
2. Token Generation: JWT with coach role and ID
   Payload: {"sub": "coach_id", "role": "coach", "email": "..."}
   
3. Token Usage: Include in Authorization header
   Header: "Authorization: Bearer <coach_token>"
   
4. Access Control: Coach role permissions applied
   - ✅ Can access /api/coaches/me
   - ❌ Cannot access /api/coaches (admin only)
```

### Testing Results

```bash
# All tests passed:
✅ Coach login successful (200 OK)
✅ Token generation working
✅ Coach profile endpoint working (200 OK)
✅ Permission restrictions working (403 for admin endpoints)
✅ Invalid login rejected (401 Unauthorized)
```

### Usage Examples

#### 1. Coach Login
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8003/api/coaches/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "coach@example.com",
    "password": "CoachPassword123!"
  }'
```

#### 2. Get Coach Profile
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8003/api/coaches/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <coach_token>"
```

### Security Features

- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT token with expiration (24 hours)
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Account status validation (active/inactive)
- ✅ Input validation with Pydantic
- ✅ Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Database Integration

- **Collection**: `coaches`
