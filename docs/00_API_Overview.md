# Marshalats Learning Management System - API Documentation Overview

## Introduction
Welcome to the comprehensive API documentation for the Marshalats Learning Management System. This system provides a complete solution for managing martial arts schools, including student enrollment, course management, instructor coordination, branch operations, and administrative functions.

## System Architecture
The API is built using FastAPI with MongoDB as the database, providing a modern, scalable, and high-performance backend solution for martial arts school management.

### Technology Stack

- **Database:** MongoDB with Motor (async driver)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger

## Base URLs
```
Development: http://localhost:8001/api
Production: https://edumanage-44.preview.dev.com/api
```

## Authentication Overview
The system implements dual authentication mechanisms:

### 1. Regular User Authentication (`/api/auth/`)
- **Purpose:** Authentication for students, coaches, coach admins, and regular super admins
- **Token Duration:** 24 hours
- **Roles:** `student`, `coach`, `coach_admin`, `super_admin`

### 2. Superadmin Authentication (`/api/superadmin/`)
- **Purpose:** Dedicated system for superadmin operations with enhanced privileges
- **Token Duration:** 24 hours
- **Role:** `superadmin`

### Authentication Header Format
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

## User Roles and Permissions

### Role Hierarchy
