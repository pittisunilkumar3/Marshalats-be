# Coach Management API Documentation

## Overview
The Coach Management API provides comprehensive functionality for managing martial arts instructors in the Marshalats Learning Management System. It supports complex nested data structures for personal information, professional details, contact information, and authentication.

## Base URL
```
Development: http://localhost:8001/api/coaches
Production: https://edumanage-44.preview.dev.com/api/coaches
```

## Authentication
Most endpoints require authentication via Bearer token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### Getting Authentication Token
For coach management operations, you can use either coach login or superadmin login:

#### Option 1: Coach Login
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/coaches/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "coach@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

#### Option 2: Superadmin Login (Full Access)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/superadmin/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "superadmin@example.com",
    "password": "StrongPassword@123"
  }'
```

## Integration Notes

### Authentication Integration
- Coach login generates JWT tokens with "coach" role
- Tokens are valid for 24 hours by default
- Password reset functionality available through admin endpoints

### Course Integration
- Coaches can be assigned as instructors to courses
- `instructor_id` in courses references coach IDs
- Coach expertise areas should align with course categories

### Branch Integration
- Coaches can be assigned to specific branches
- Branch assignments affect coach permissions and access
- Multiple coaches can be assigned to the same branch

### User Management Integration
- Coaches are stored in a separate `coaches` collection
- Different from regular users in the `users` collection
- Unified authentication system supports both coach and user tokens

### Notification Integration
- SMS and WhatsApp notifications sent on coach creation
- Temporary passwords communicated securely
- Activity logging for all coach management operations
