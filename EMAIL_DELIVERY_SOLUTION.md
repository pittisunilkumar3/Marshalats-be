## 🚨 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

The issue is **NOT technical** - it's related to **email deliverability factors**:

### 🎯 **Primary Causes (Most Likely)**

1. **📧 Spam/Junk Folder Placement**
   - New sender domains often trigger spam filters
   - Gmail/Outlook are particularly aggressive with unknown senders
   - Corporate email systems may have strict filtering

2. **🔍 Email Provider Filtering**
   - Gmail may silently filter emails from new domains
   - Some providers require sender reputation building
   - Bulk email detection algorithms may flag system emails

3. **⏰ Delivery Delays**
   - New senders often experience 5-30 minute delays
   - Email providers may queue emails for reputation checks
   - Peak times can cause additional delays

4. **📱 Email Client Sync Issues**
   - Mobile apps may not sync immediately
   - IMAP/POP3 sync intervals can cause delays
   - Some clients cache aggressively

## 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS**

### 🔍 **Step 1: Check Spam/Junk Folders**

**Gmail Users:**
1. Open Gmail
2. Click "More" in left sidebar
